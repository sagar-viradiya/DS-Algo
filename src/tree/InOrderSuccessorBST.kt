package tree


/*
Given a node in a binary search tree, return the next bigger element, also known as the inorder successor.

For example, the inorder successor of 22 is 30.

   10
  /  \
 5    30
     /  \
   22    35


For example, the inorder successor of 23 is 30

   10
  /  \
 5    30
     /  \
   22    35
    \
     23

Solution:

1 If right subtree of node is not NULL, then succ lies in right subtree. Do following.
  Go to right subtree and return the node with minimum key value in right subtree.
2 If right sbtree of node is NULL, then succ is one of the ancestors. Do following.
  Travel up using the parent pointer until you see a node which is left child of itâ€™s parent.
  The parent of such a node is the succ.

                input = right as Node
